Channel Rate(HZ)	Transmit Energy(J)	Listen Energy(J)	CPU Energy(J)		LPM Energy(J)
4			1.614			0.470			0.803			0.9
8			0.842			0.706			0.511			0.34
16			0.421			1.177			0.382			0.6

Transmit energy decreases as channel rate increases while other components' energy consumption decrease.

* The assignment asks for 6 configurations but ContikiMAC and CSMA are at different layers there is actually 3
possible configurations.
